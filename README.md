TinyMediaManager Plug-In for TV-Browser
=================

This is a plug-in for TV-Browser, which can be used to look up movies in the database of TinyMediaManager. It is useful, if you are about
to schedule a recording for movie, but you are not sure, if the movie already is part of your collection. I don't plan to make it an
official plug-in, but you are free to use it of course.
